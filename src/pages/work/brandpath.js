        <p>Iâ€™d been looking a React for a while, but hadn&apos;t had the chance to use on a live project&hellip;</p>
        <p>Previously built in Wordpress, the redesign of the Brandpath site seemed like a good opportunity to try Gatsby, JSX and add some basic interactivity using React. I also leveraged reusable components to keep the site as DRY as possible.</p>
        <p>The design and layout was provided from another designer internally using corporate brochure assets. Layout on mobile wasn&apos;t really considered, so I need to retrofit RWD while keeping the site as close to the original mock-ups as possible.</p>
        <p>I also implemented Webp optimised images (with .jpg fallbacks using &lt;picture&gt; tags) and used Lighthouse to discover and fix any performance issues.</p>
